Clone repository to your raspberry pi.
I've used crontab to create schedule.
1. Set schedule for get_forec.py (download forecast data from SMHI)
2. Set schedule for weather_rep.py, program start supposed to be at 7.30.

You need to install omxplayer
sudo apt-get install omxplayer


TODO search for data with time stample
